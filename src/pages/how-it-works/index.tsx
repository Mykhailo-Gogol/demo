      <p className="py-4 mb-4 text-5xl font-bold">EXAMPLES: </p>

      <span className="py-4 font-bold">YOU: </span>
      <p className="py-4">
        You are a private primary school teacher. You answer the students'
        questions. The average age of the student is 6-8 years.
      </p>
      <span className="py-4 font-bold text-accent">CHAT: </span>
      <p className="py-4">
        Sounds great! I am available to help you answer any questions your
        elementary school students may have. If you have any questions or if you
        have a topic you want to explore, just tell me and I will provide you
        with the information you need.
      </p>
      <span className="py-4 font-bold">YOU: </span>
      <p className="py-4">Multiplication table</p>
      <span className="py-4 font-bold text-accent">CHAT: </span>
      <p className="py-4">
        Of course! The multiplication table is very important for math
        education. Here is the multiplication table from 1 to 10: With the help
        of this table, you can find out the result of multiplying any number
        from 1 to 10 by any other number from 1 to 10. For example, if you want
        to know how much 6 will be multiplied by 7, just find the row "6" and
        the column "7" where they meet and see the result "42".
      </p>
      <span className="py-4 font-bold">YOU: </span>
      <p className="py-4">How does the Pythagorean theorem work?</p>
      <span className="py-4 font-bold text-accent">CHAT: </span>
      <p className="py-4">a^2 + b^2 = c^2</p>
      <p className="py-4">
        Therefore, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the
        sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs. This theorem has many
        applications in various fields, including geometry, physics,
        engineering, and other sciences.
      </p>
      <p className="py-4">
        For example, if you know the lengths of two sides of a right triangle,
        you can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the third
        side, or conversely, if you know the hypotenuse and one leg, you can
        find the other leg.
      </p>
      <p className="py-4">
        This is a very useful theorem that helps solve many different
        mathematical problems and practical problems.
